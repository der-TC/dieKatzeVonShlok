/*
 * This class is the DrawInfo node of a tree used to draw other trees.
 * 
 * This class:
 *   - HAS-A  node  (of the tree it is actually illustrating/drawing)
 *   - HAS-A  (x,y) and (width, height)
 *   - level : the vertical level or height. Root = 0. 
 *   - rowOrdinal : The position of this node on this level of the drawn tree.
 *
 *   - IS-A  Node.  (This Node both IS-A Node and HAS-A Node)
 *
 * This DrawInfo class is a Node that is used to hold all the illustration
 * information that allows us to draw the Tree nicely. We construct
 * a "mirror tree" which is a Tree with the exact same structure (children,
 * height, etc) of the tree we are illustrating. But, this Tree is using
 * DrawInfo nodes to give us nice draing information.
